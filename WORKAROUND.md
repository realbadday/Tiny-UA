# Workaround for Stuck Improve Mode

## If you're stuck in the `...` prompt:

1. **Press Ctrl+C** to force exit the current operation

2. **Alternative approach - Use chat mode instead:**
   ```
   /mode chat
   Please improve this code for efficiency: def hello(): print("Hello World")
   ```

3. **Use the standalone improve script:**
   ```bash
   # Exit your current session with Ctrl+C
   # Then run:
   python3 improve_code.py
   ```

## The Issue

The improve mode has a design flaw where:
1. You switch to improve mode
2. Type anything (like "improve this") 
3. It enters multiline mode
4. But then EOF doesn't properly exit and process

## Better Alternatives

### Option 1: Stay in chat mode
```
[ðŸ’¬ CHAT] >>> improve this code: def add(a,b): return a+b
```

### Option 2: Use code/script mode with improvement request
```
[ðŸ’» CODE] >>> rewrite this function to be more efficient: def sum_list(lst): total=0; for i in lst: total+=i; return total
```

### Option 3: Use the improve_code.py script
```bash
python3 improve_code.py
# Paste code
# Type END
```

## To permanently fix this issue

The code needs to be refactored so that selecting improve mode immediately prompts for code input without requiring an intermediate step.
