# TinyLlama Training Setup - Fixed and Working! ✅

## Issue Summary
The training function was not working due to missing Python dependencies. This has been **completely resolved**.

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ **Missing Dependencies**: Installed `transformers`, `peft`, `accelerate`, and `tqdm`
2. ✅ **Environment Issues**: Created isolated virtual environment `tinyllama_env`
3. ✅ **Dataset Problems**: Created sample dataset for testing
4. ✅ **Verification**: Successfully ran complete training cycle with test prompts

## Quick Start

### 1. Activate Training Environment
```bash
cd /home/jason/projects/tinyllama
./activate_training.sh
```

### 2. Run Training (Simple)
```bash
python train_tinyllama.py --dataset data/sample_dataset.csv --epochs 1 --test-prompts
```

### 3. Run Training (Full)
```bash
python train_tinyllama.py \
  --dataset data/sample_dataset.csv \
  --epochs 3 \
  --batch-size 1 \
  --learning-rate 2e-4 \
  --merge-weights \
  --test-prompts
```

## What's Included
- **Virtual Environment**: `tinyllama_env/` with all dependencies
- **Sample Dataset**: `data/sample_dataset.csv` with 10 Python Q&A pairs
- **Activation Script**: `activate_training.sh` for easy environment setup
- **Trained Model**: Saves to `models/` directory

## Training Results from Test Run
- **Model Downloaded**: TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 (2.2GB)
- **LoRA Parameters**: 12.6M trainable (1.13% of total)
- **Training Time**: ~1 minute for 1 epoch on 10 samples
- **Test Responses**: Generated coherent Python programming answers

## Example Training Output
```
2025-09-04 11:00:15,390 - INFO - Applying LoRA configuration...
trainable params: 12,615,680 || all params: 1,112,664,064 || trainable%: 1.1338
2025-09-04 11:00:15,614 - INFO - Loading dataset from data/sample_dataset.csv
2025-09-04 11:00:15,615 - INFO - Loaded 10 training samples
✅ Fine-tuning completed!
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Dataset
Create your own CSV with `question,answer` columns:
```csv
question,answer
"Your question here","[\"Your answer here\"]"
```

### Training Parameters
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs (default: 3)
- `--batch-size`: Batch size for CPU training (keep at 1)
- `--learning-rate`: Learning rate (default: 2e-4)
- `--max-length`: Maximum sequence length (default: 512)
- `--merge-weights`: Merge LoRA weights for easier deployment
- `--test-prompts`: Test model with sample questions after training

## Troubleshooting
- **Environment Issues**: Run `./activate_training.sh` first
- **Memory Problems**: Keep batch-size at 1 for CPU training
- **Import Errors**: All dependencies are now properly installed in virtual environment

## Technical Details
- **Base Model**: TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
- **Fine-tuning Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Training Backend**: Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT
- **Target**: CPU-optimized training

The training function is now **fully operational** and ready for your custom datasets!

## Recent Fixes
- ✅ **Response Extraction Fix**: Resolved issue where generated responses were missing first few characters
- ✅ **TTS Integration**: Clean audio output without ALSA warnings  
- ✅ **Environment Isolation**: All dependencies properly contained in virtual environment
