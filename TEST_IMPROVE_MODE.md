# Testing Improve Mode - Fixed Version

The improve mode has been fixed. Here's how to test it:

## Step by step:

1. Launch TinyLlama:
   ```
   ./launch.sh
   ```

2. Switch to improve mode:
   ```
   /mode improve
   ```

3. Type any text to trigger multiline mode (e.g., "improve this"):
   ```
   improve this
   ```

4. You'll see the prompt change to `...` - now paste your code:
   ```python
   def calculate_sum(numbers):
       total = 0
       for i in range(len(numbers)):
           total = total + numbers[i]
       return total
   ```

5. Type `EOF` on its own line to process

## Expected result:

The model should now generate an improved version of your code with better efficiency, such as:
```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)
```

## Note:

The quality of the improvement depends on the model's training. TinyLlama-1.1B might not always generate perfect improvements, but it should at least attempt to improve the code rather than generating unrelated code.

## Alternative: Stay in chat mode

You can also just stay in chat mode and ask directly:
```
Please improve this code for efficiency: def calculate_sum(numbers): return sum([n for n in numbers])
```
